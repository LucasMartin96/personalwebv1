  bio: `
    Hello! My journey into programming began with my love for gaming. Back in 2010, I took my first step into the world of code when I attempted to create my own server for a popular Argentinian game. That first exposure to programming, though challenging, sparked a curiosity that would shape my future path.

    Fast forward to today, what started as a gaming enthusiasm has evolved into a professional passion. Through my university education and continuous self-learning, I've developed a deep understanding of software development and never stopped expanding my knowledge.

    Currently, I'm focused on backend development, crafting robust and scalable server-side solutions. While I work across the full stack, I'm particularly passionate about building efficient APIs, optimizing database performance, and implementing complex business logic using technologies like .NET and working with various database systems.
